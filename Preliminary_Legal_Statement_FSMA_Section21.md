# Preliminary Legal Statement – Regulatory Position under the UK FSMA Section 21

**Subject:** Regulatory characterization of exchangeStoz.com operations and communication under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).

**Date:** October 9, 2025

## Platform Nature and Operations

exchangeStoz.com operates as a non-custodial decentralized platform that provides technological infrastructure for the deployment of smart contracts and the decentralized storage of offering documentation (such as Offering Memoranda) on public blockchains (mainnet) and decentralized storage networks (IPFS).

The platform does not issue, promote, or market any security tokens of its own, nor does it hold or manage client assets, private keys, or investor funds. Its core functionality is limited to providing tools that enable third-party issuers to technically register and disclose information in a transparent and immutable manner.

## Primary Market Functionality

Within the primary market functionality, exchangeStoz.com enables issuers to upload offering-related documentation to decentralized storage. This process does not constitute a financial promotion under Section 21 FSMA, as the platform does not directly engage in or approve any investment communications directed to the UK public.

The responsibility for the content, accuracy, and compliance of any offering materials remains entirely with the issuer.

## Compliance and Jurisdictional Controls

All security token offerings (STOs) or listings that may fall within the scope of regulated financial promotions undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) and jurisdictional verification process. These procedures ensure that each issuer and offering is assessed for:

- Applicable jurisdiction and investor categories;
- Compliance with relevant securities regulations, including Section 21 FSMA;
- Restrictions on public marketing or retail investor access where required.

The platform implements access and communication controls designed to prevent unauthorized promotion to UK retail investors unless a valid exemption or FCA-approved communication applies.

## Conclusion

Based on the described structure and operational model, exchangeStoz.com functions as a technological service provider rather than a promoter or issuer of financial instruments.

Accordingly, while individual issuers may be subject to specific regulatory requirements under UK law, the platform's role — as a non-custodial infrastructure provider that facilitates decentralized issuance and disclosure — is not itself subject to Section 21 FSMA, provided that all communication and KYC/jurisdictional controls are maintained as described.

## Disclaimer

This statement is provided for informational and compliance purposes only and does not constitute formal legal advice. Parties should seek independent legal counsel to confirm the application of UK financial promotion rules to their specific use cases and jurisdictions.
